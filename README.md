# Stocks-Analysis
## Overview of the Project
This project is to analyze 12 stocks' performance in 2017 and 2018 and to uncover which one is promosing for investors. Basically, stocks with higher daily transcation volumes and yearly returns suggest more values and interests for investors. In this project, I will analyze 12 stocks' yearly returns, as well as their total daily transaction volumes in 2017 and 2018. Also, I write two macros for this project and to see whether the refactored one works more efficiently for users. The project will include the result of stock analysis, buying advice, and comparison of two sets of codes.

## Results
### Analysis of Stock Performance
Stocks with positive returns are formated in green while stocks with negative returns are in red. As we can see from the image of the stock performance in 2017, except the stock TERP had a negative yearly return, or a loss, other stocks all increased in values. DQ had the best yearly return, or surged 199.4% in 2017. Other stocks like SEDG, ENPH, FSLR also generated high returns of 184.5%, 129.5%, 101.3% respectively. As for total daily traded volumes, though DQ gained the most in return, it had the least volumes of $35,796,200. SPWR and FSLR had the most volumes of $782,187,000 and $684,181,400, respectively.

While looking into the analysis result of all stocks in 2018, we will surprisingly find out that most stocks had negative yearly returns, or declined in values. DQ had the worst return of -62.6%, also stocks like JKS, SPWR, FSLR plummeted 60.5%, 44.6%, and 39.7% in a year. Only two stocks ENPH and RUN survived and generated great profits. ENPH rose 81.9% and RUN rose 84.0%. As for their total volumes, ENPH traded more or $607,473,500 in total.

### Buying Suggestions
After the analysis of all stocks in two years, ENPH is more likely to generate profits for investors in terms of its good returns in two years and big traded volumes.
